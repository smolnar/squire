# Squire

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/smolnar/squire/master/squire.png "Source: http://www.printactivities.com/ColoringPages/Knights/Squire.html")

Squire is your configuration squire thats bears your configuration for object, so you don't need to worry about bunch of settings.

It's designed to support multiple formats (for now, Hash and YML) and replace [Settingslogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/settingslogic) that lacks some crutial features like default/base namespace or extensibility for another source formats.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'squire'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install squire

## Usage

### Setting up existing module or class

If you want to provide configuration for existing object or class, just include `Squire` like this

```ruby
class Elephant
  include Squire

  squire.source    'source.yml' # or Hash
  squire.namespace 'namespace'
    
  # or 
    
  squire do
    namespace 'namespace'
    ....
  end
```

After that, you can access `Elephanth.config`. For example:

```ruby
Elephant.config.a # => value from in source.yml

Elephant.config.a? # => true

# You can change loaded settings as you like during runtime
Elephant.config do |config|
  config.a = 1
  
  config.nested do |nested|
    ....
  end
end
```

No other methods except `squire` and `config` are included.

### Settingslogic equivalence

For replacing Settingslogic functionality, you can refactor your configuration like this:

```yaml
-- source.yml

common: &common
  a: 1
  b: 2
    
  nested:
      c: 3
        
namespace:
  <<: *common
    
  nested:
    d: 4
```

```ruby
class Configuration
  include Squire::Base
    
  squire.source    'source.yml'
  squire.namespace 'namespace', base: :common
end

Configuration.nested.d # => 4
Configuration.nested.c # => 3

# or

Configuration.config.nested.d # => 4
Configuration.config.nested.c # => 3
```

After including `Squire::Base`, you can access `squire` and `config`, but you dont have to write `Configuration.config.a` to access settings, just type `Configuration.a` and the call gets delegated to `config`.

Default namespace set by `base` option in `squire.namespace` is used for merging default values for all namespaces, since they get overriden by YAML and other parsers. For more information, see [Settingslogic issue](https://github.com/binarylogic/settingslogic/issues/21).
